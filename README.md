Structure:
  Create a folder and in that newly created folder put the forge folder from the repository, make a new folder called code.
  In the code folder you put your custom mod projects. e.g. ExtraTools mod
  
  the tree should look like this:
    -dev_folder_
                |__ forge
                |__ code _
                          |__ExtraTools
                          
  You point your eclipse  workspace to the code file, and import forge as a project and if you have to the ExtraTools project
